# Vibe

## Vibe is a fully on-chain social participation protocol that helps you enhance events, and capture their memories。

Vibe is web-based frontend application, that leverages blockchain technology to enhance the experience of both in person and remote events. Once users mint a profile, they can then be invited to participate in events and share memories with their wider communities.

Event organisers can incentivise user behaviour, offer rewards and customise the staging of the memories based on these, which are captured on-chain in a sharable fashion.

In the longer term, Vibe will allow organisers to gamify every aspect of social events, and champion those who contribute the most, letting them capture that moment in a permanent on-chain memory.
